  // Scoping variables means "where are these variables available to me"
  // var variables are function scoped - available inside the function they are created in
  // let and const variables are BLOCK SCOPED instead of function scoped.

  // We cannot redeclare 'let' twice in the same scope, unlike var. This is good! Declaring a single var twice is bad practice.

  // Const = constant - its a variable that can not update. We can update properties of that variable (object properties, for example), but not the var itself.

  // Let: scope something to a block - this is a block: {}
